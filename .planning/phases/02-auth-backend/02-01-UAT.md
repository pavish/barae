## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. Dev stack starts with auth tables
expected: Run `docker compose -f compose.dev.yml up` (or restart if already running). Backend starts without errors — no "missing env var" errors for AUTH_BASE_URL.
result: pass

### 2. Migration applies cleanly
expected: Run `docker compose -f compose.dev.yml exec backend npx tsx scripts/migrate.ts` (or however you run migrations). Should output success — auth tables (user, session, account, verification) created in the database.
result: pass

### 3. Auth tables exist in database
expected: Connect to the dev PostgreSQL database and verify: `\dt` shows `user`, `session`, `account`, and `verification` tables. All four tables should exist with proper columns.
result: pass
